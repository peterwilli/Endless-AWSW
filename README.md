# The AI-enhanced universe of Angels with Scaly Wings!

I'm working on a mod called Endless AWSW that will mix the normal AWSW game with AI-generated prompts and stories. It's likely going to be not as good as the "real story" but if you're like me (can't get enough of the game) then you will get more of your dragon friends in their dragon world.

## Installation

This is still in a heavy research and pre-alpha phase. I don't really feel like writing installation docs to software that's likely going to change so heavily. This repo mainly functions for backup keeping for now!

If you want to help out, please [ping me on my Discord](https://discord.gg/gKcb5U3) (You can also DM me at EmeraldOdinðŸ”’#1991 but sometimes change the name, so it's a gamble hehe)
