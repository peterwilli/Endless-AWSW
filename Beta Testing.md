# Beta testing EAWSW

Thanks for joining! It's really nice to see people interested. 

The purpose of this document is to get you prepared not just to test out the mod but also to know where to send appropriate feedback when something goes wrong or a bug has been found.

While this mod can be fun, the purpose of this beta **is to eliminate bugs and find good feature requests!** Please make sure you're ready to provide appropriate feedback, if you're just interested to play, it's recommended to wait for the "final" release so that server-space and computation power is saved for those that are going to test this mod and provide feedback.

## How to install the mod

- Follow [the tutorial here](./README.md#installation)

## Where to provide feedback

There are multiple ways to reach me, I'll list the options below, sorted by preference:

 - [GitHub issues](https://github.com/peterwilli/Endless-AWSW/issues)
 - [AWSW Discord server](https://discord.gg/Hg5jqT6) (Ping EmeraldOdin#1991)
 - [My discord server](https://discord.gg/SYhaMe4wJv)

 When reporting bugs, make sure to type "h" + enter in the player prompt, and share the version number it shows + what is in the debug menu, so we can replicate things easier.
 
 Share screenshots of the error if anything happens, so I can track the issue down much faster.
