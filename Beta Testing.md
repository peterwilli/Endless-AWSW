# Beta testing EAWSW

Thanks for joining! It's really nice to see people interested. 

The purpose of this document is to get you prepared not just to test out the mod but also to know where to send appropriate feedback when something goes wrong or a bug has been found.

## How to install the mod

- Follow [the tutorial here](./README.md#installation)

## Where to provide feedback

There are multiple ways to reach me, I'll list the options below, sorted by preference:

 - [GitHub issues](https://github.com/peterwilli/Endless-AWSW/issues)
 - [AWSW Discord server](https://discord.gg/Hg5jqT6) (Ping EmeraldOdin#1991)
 - [My discord server](https://discord.gg/SYhaMe4wJv)

 When reporting bugs, make sure to type `h + enter` in the player prompt, and share the version number it shows + what is in the debug menu, so we can replicate things easier.
 
 Share screenshots of the error if anything happens, so I can track the issue down much faster.
