# Beta testing EAWSW

Thanks for joining! It's really nice to see people interested. 

The purpose of this document is to get you prepared not just to test out the mod but also to know where to send appropiate feedback when something goes wrong or a bug has been found.

While this mod can be fun, the purpose of this beta **is to eliminate bugs and find good feature requests!** Please make sure you're ready to provide appropiate feedback, if you're just interested to play, it's recommended to wait for the "final" release so that server-space and computation power is saved for those that are going to test this mod and provide feedback.

## How to install the mod

- Follow [the tutorial here](./README.md#installation)

## Where to provide feedback

There are multiple ways to reach me, I'll list the options below, sorted by preference:

 - [GitHub issues](https://github.com/peterwilli/Endless-AWSW/issues)
 - [AWSW Discord server](https://discord.gg/Hg5jqT6) (Ping EmeraldOdin#1991)
 - [My discord server](https://discord.gg/SYhaMe4wJv)

 When reporting bugs, make sure to type "version" in the player prompt and share screenshots of the error if anything happens, so I can track the issue down much faster.

 ## Common issues

 ### Slow response time

 When using the public server, you can encounter slow replies especially when things get crowded. While I did everything to make sure requests are evenly distributed and rate-limited across players (IP addresses), I'm still the only person hosting one.

 [You can install your own server](Installing%20your%20own%20server.md) if you have a beefy computer and the skills to install it. **Please ping me using the feedback channels if you wish to host a public server** to speed things up!
