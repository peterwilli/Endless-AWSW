# Installing your own server

This tutorial is to host your own EAWSW server. Hosting your own server is interesting if you:

 - Are training your own model and wish to test it out in the actual game.
 - Want to run a private server and not be dependent on the public servers if they go offline or get slow during busy times.
 - Are paranoid and afraid that someone gets to know what you say to Remy when you finally get to meet him ðŸ˜‚

## Notes

- While it *should* be possible that this runs on Windows, I use Linux and is not sure how to run this on Windows. Feel free to adjust this tutorial for Windows, and I'll accept the PR.

## Prerequisites

You need the following software / files:

- [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](docker)
- [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](docker-compose)
