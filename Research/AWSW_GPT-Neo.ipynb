The result would be a number of different species, each with a different amount of resemblance to humans.\" DragonReply Lo relieved flip \"You just want to study [player_name]!\" DragonReply Lo think flip \"I thought you had experiments to run.\" DragonReply Lo relieved flip \"But no experiments on [player_name]!\" DragonReply Lo \"I'm sorry, [player_name].

It took me quite a while, but maybe we can compare notes and make sure we're right.\" DragonReply Br \"What strange contraptions.\" DragonReply Br \"Well, he could have had a reason to use a knife over his \\\"gun\\\" if it was him.
