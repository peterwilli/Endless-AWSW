    "# Conversion to ONNX\n",
    "ONNX is a different format for running machine learning models. The ONNX format is much faster on CPU, sometimes 5 times as fast as PyTorch!\n",
    "\n",
    "While the EAWSW model is designed to be small, accurate and accessible, for some people it's still too much to run...\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosting the model as a free service for players is an option. An ONNX version of the model allows us to host the model on CPU yet have faster response times! Given that the model is made in a time with chip shortage, running on hardware I already have inside a server is efficient, scalable and cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note is that ONNX doesn't execute logic by itself, and you have to do that yourself, `onnx_model_manager.py` intends to deal with this for us."
